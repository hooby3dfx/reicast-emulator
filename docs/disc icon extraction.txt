Extracting icon file from any disc image

high level:
-Make method that takes a path of the image
-Use existing code to load that disc
-Add code to use that and find the data track
-Get access to iso file system in that track
-Copy out 0GDTEX.PVR
-Convert to PNG
-save PNG as "same_name_as_disc".png
-add android code to do this for all titles if there is no png
-add code to read png files and show them for each game




notes:

how disc files are loaded now:
-path of image is passed as arg for virtual cfg
-ImgReader.cpp libGDR_Init
-common.cpp InitDrive
-common.cpp InitDrive_ attempts to load with each driver (chd, gdi, cdi; one of them should work!)
	-these all extend Disc
	-driver generates the tracks
	-Disc FillGDSession
	-***at this point should be able to access data track***
-gdromv3.cpp libCore_gdrom_disc_change!
